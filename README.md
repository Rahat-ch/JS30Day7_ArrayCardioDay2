# JS30Day7_ArrayCardioDay2

Learned more array methods today! Made it through a week and I'm already feeling like I can do quite a lot more than I could a week ago. These have been incredibly helpful for developing my skills. I've flagged this and the other Array Cardio day for additional review. 

As usual here is the depoloyed project:
